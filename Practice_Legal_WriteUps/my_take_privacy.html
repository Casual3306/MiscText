<p class="p1">My take on privacy - Opinion</p>
<p class="p2"><i>“To achieve total privacy, one has to cut off from the world, cut off from senses, isolate themselves in nothing, until one cannot hear, taste, smell, or feel...”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></i></p>
<p class="p3">Privacy…I learned, after reading at least ten pages from the article so graciously provided by my professor of the Legal Cyber Security Aspects, is an immensely complicated aspect and topic. Privacy effects us all as individuals. Us, as individuals, use privacy as a means of escape, as a means of isolating ourselves and our thoughts and actions that the rest of society might deem as "not good" or "not befitting of societal values". But, as stated in the article, is this solitude where we can be our selves or our true selves REALLY private? In the article, on page 4 of PDF and page 44 of the article, it states that even in such solitudes, we are disturbed, distracted even, by mental and psychological aspects and senses such as: sight, smell, hearing, taste, and much more which brings up a question: how do we achieve FULL privacy? Well, to my guess and theory, we can do this by simply taking away the senses OR locking ourselves away from society the noise, the smells, the taste, locking ourselves away in a white room with, what we can perceive, has no surveillance devices and nothing to disturb our peace BUT, would a person really be satisfied? Even if those things were to be taken away, if the sights, sounds, smells, and by extreme aspects, feelings be taken away and we were left in a white room with ourselves with no one monitoring us remotely, we STILL would not achieve full privacy why? Because, and this is opinion, psychologically we would start to break down (we would still have the distraction of feelings) and we would start to become paranoid not only with what can be perceived as outside remote monitoring, but with ourselves. The mind trying to succumb to total complete privacy and isolation from society for which it wasn't meant to be isolated from  would have great difficulty coping with such a matter…I feel as though I merely dented the surface of such privacy but in fact, I haven't made a dent at all. Privacy, I read is entangled to a large amount of (complex) theories, thoughts, speculations, and statements that it becomes hard to decipher the very meaning at times.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"> </p>
<p class="p3">All in all, total privacy cannot be achieved. There is always going to be the worry about someone watching you remotely, without your knowledge or consent. I read in the article where it defined a "friend" in basic terminology, that term defined by the article would be: "is someone of whom I can think aloud". I agree with this as a friend would listen and not judge. A friend is someone, one, can think aloud to, someone you can vent to your feelings, frustrations, complaints, your deepest, darkest thoughts at times and trust that certain individual to not share your mind which you have bestowed upon them the unlocked secrets which one has been keeping personal and reserve. But, how often does that work? How often can you tell a friend your deepest darkest sessions and they were so taken aback that they could not bear the weight of the information provided and they need to vent that to THEIR "trusted" friend? Which brings me to my next point: when you bestow your personal information to someone who has their own links (friends), that information can be twisted and distorted and what I mean by that is, that information when passed from source to person one and person one passes it to person two and so on the recursion goes (meanwhile the information changes with each iteration) before it comes back to the person a jumbled mess of incoherent nonsensical web of what started out as a shared thought from which was pulled and given to the so called friend. Maybe it is just me, I don't know.</p>

<p class="p3">[Little Note]</p>
<p class="p3">Off course, in some places of the world and even here, privacy is a twisted sense. One can believe that they are safe in their sanctuary which is called home but with all the tech and devices is home really a place for privacy? How can we tell with all the proprietary devices that we use and have no knowledge of the internal workings of such a device? The thing is, we can't. Producers can fill a "normal" mind with all sorts of information and when information is technical enough, then the average person will tend to believe the producer and the producer can program the zombie to collect data on the average and thus sell that data to other buyers so that the buyers may utilize that data to offer the average person "recommendations" in forms of ads, banners, and "fishing pole, hook, and worm" sort of "enticements" - "Prevailing market based approach to a persons privacy…”.</p>
